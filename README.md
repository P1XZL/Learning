### **What is this?**
This is a github repository for my personal learning of various things.
These things include learning yaml, python, workflows and git.

### **Why?**
I had some trouble learning these things. There are enough tutorials online, though, they only provide knowledge, not how to use that knowledge.
In this repository, I will document my journey for people running into the same issues as me.
I hope this works out for me and you.
